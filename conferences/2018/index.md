# SPNHC+TDWG Joint Conference

In 2018, TDWG met jointly with the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections ([SPNHC](https://spnhc.org/resources/33rd-annual-meeting-collections-and-data-in-an-unstable-world/)) in Dunedin, New Zealand. The meeting was hosted by the [Otago Museum](https://otagomuseum.nz/) and held on the adjacent University of Otago campus.

The [TDWG portion of the conference website](https://tdwg.github.io/conferences/2018/sessions/), particularly the session details, is still available.  [Abstracts for individual presentations and posters](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/62/) were published in our journal, [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards](https://biss.pensoft.net). [Abstracts for the 2018 SPNHC Conference](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/63/) are available in BISS as a parallel collection.
