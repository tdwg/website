_Last updated 9 May 2023_

We are pleased to announce the call for abstracts for [TDWG 2023](/conferences/2023/), the hybrid conference of [Biodiversity Information Standards](/) (TDWG), which will be held 9â€“13 October 2023 in Hobart, Tasmania. Abstracts will be submitted to and published in [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net/).

**The deadline for abstract submission is** [1 July 2023](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Deadline+TDWG+2023+Call+for+abstracts&iso=20230701T235959&p1=103). 

Abstracts will be peer reviewed and authors may be asked to make editorial changes to their abstract. Final approval for publication requires payment of any conference registration fees by the presenter. Content may be presented either in-person, virtually, or pre-recorded for TDWG 2023. Sessions will be recorded and session videos will be made available.

## About the conference

In addition to opening and closing plenaries, the conference will feature 17 symposia and a mix of other formats that include four workshops, a demo, and panel discussion as well as contributed oral presentations and virtual posters.

## What you need to know
