**Join us in Okinawa for the first ever Biodiversity Bingo Night at the [Sky Bar Top Tree](https://toptree-naha.com/en/) in downtown Naha on Tuesday, September 3rd!**

Test your knowledge about organisms from Japan’s rich bio-history. Win prizes that will amaze your friends and still fit into your carry-on bag. Enjoy [delicious food and refreshing drinks](https://toptree-naha.com/food-drink/) all in the company of your friends, family and colleagues. Relax into the 7th-floor vibe of one of Okinawa’s newest social and culinary venues. We’ll have the place to ourselves between 19:00-22:00 (that’s 7-10pm). Event hosted by members of our very own SPNHC-TDWG Social Task Group.

**$40 per person. Ticket includes:**
- All the bingo you can handle.
- One drink and two food tickets (with the option to purchase more on-site)
- Round-trip bus transportation from the Ginowan City Gymnasium (in between the Okinawa Convention Center and Laguna Garden Hotel) to downtown Naha.
**NOTE**: There will be a short, but level, ~12 minute walk to/from the bus drop/pick-up location and the venue.

**What is bingo?**
_In the United States and Canada, bingo is a game of chance in which each player matches the numbers printed in different arrangements on cards. The game host (known as a caller) draws balls at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles. When a player finds that the selected numbers are arranged on their card in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line, they call out "Bingo!" to alert all participants to a winning card..._ from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bingo_(American_version))

**Why Bingo at SPNHC-TDWG?**
The reason is simple. We anticipate this year's meeting in Asia will attract a large number of people for whom English is not their native tongue and so we wanted to offer a fun and social experience that does not require advanced study. Bingo is a game that almost anyone can play regardless of the languages they speak.

## The SPNHC-TDWG 2024 T-shirt

The SPNHC-TDWG 2024 Conference T-shirt has arrived!!!

This year's shirt features the conference logo designed by Ms. Takako Tomozawa, from the NPO Osaka Natural History Center, and the SPNHC and TDWG logos. The conference logo incorporates an original illustration of the Iriomote cat by Prof. Mitsuru Moriguchi of Okinawa University. The shirts are:
- Available on black and white
- Short-sleeved without a pocket
- Printed on one side only.
- **Only $20 USD**

All t-shirts will be provided at the registration desk in Okinawa. If you are not coming to the meeting in-person, you can order a shirt. We will happily give your order to another attendee who is from your country or region to bring back to you. It will then be up to you to determine the best way to get the shirt. SPNHC-TDWG cannot arrange for or pay for shipping. Just let us know to whom we should give your order via [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).
