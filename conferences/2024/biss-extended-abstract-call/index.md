_Last updated 10 June 2024_

We are pleased to announce the call for extended abstracts (mini-papers) for the joint hybrid conference of SPNHC-TDWG 2024 to be published in [_Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)_](https://biss.pensoft.net/collection/438/). 

**The deadline for extended abstract submission is 15 July 2024.**

Wondering why you might want to submit an extended abstract when your presentation has already been accepted on the Oxford Abstracts (OA) conference platform?  See all the reasons why here: [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/why-extended-abstract/) 

**Eligibility.** Only authors with abstracts [approved for presentation](/conferences/2024/#abstracts-submitted-to-oxford-abstracts)) at the conference are eligible to submit an extended abstract as a benefit of their registration for the conference. _The person submitting the extended abstract to BISS can be a different co-author from the one who submitted the original abstract to the conference program._ It is important that this submitting author be available to handle reviews in a timely manner.

**Full instructions** for extended abstract submission may be found at [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstract-submission/) but if you are already familiar with abstract submission to _BISS_, you may elect to use the shorter summarized version, [https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/](/conferences/2024/biss-abstracts-tldr/) 

**Please direct any questions** about extended abstracts to [editor@tdwg.org](mailto:editor@tdwg.org); questions about the conference should be directed to [okinawa2024@spnhc.org](mailto:okinawa2024@spnhc.org).

We look forward to receiving your extended abstract submissions by **15 July 2024**!
