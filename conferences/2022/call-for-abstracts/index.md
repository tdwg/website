We are pleased to announce the call for abstracts for [TDWG 2022](/conferences/2022/), the hybrid conference of [Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)](/), which will be held 17–21 October 2022 in Sofia, Bulgaria. Abstracts will be submitted to and published in [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net/). **The deadline for abstract submission is 1 July 2022.** Abstracts will be peer reviewed and final approval for publication requires payment of any registration fees by the presenter. [Registration is now open](https://events.pensoft.net/events/tdwg-2022-hybrid-conference). Content may be presented either in-person, virtually, or pre-recorded for TDWG 2022. Sessions will be recorded and made available initially only to registered attendees.

## About the conference

The theme for TDWG 2022 is **Stronger Together: Standards for linking biodiversity data.** In addition to opening and closing plenaries, the conference will feature 14 symposia and a mix of other formats that include lightning talks, a workshop, and panel discussion as well as contributed oral presentations and virtual posters.
