Abstracts will be submitted to and published in [Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS)](https://biss.pensoft.net/). **The deadline for abstract submission is 1 July 2022.** Abstracts will be peer reviewed and final approval for publication requires payment of any registration fees by the presenter.
