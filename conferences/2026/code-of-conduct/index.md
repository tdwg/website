## TDWG 2026 CODE OF CONDUCT

Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) and the organizers of TDWG 2026 are dedicated to fostering a safe, inclusive, and welcoming environment for all participants, regardless of ethnicity, religion, national origin, professional status, physical appearance, physical ability, neurodivergence, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, or other personal characteristics. By registering for or participating in any conference-related activity, you agree to abide by this Code of Conduct, which applies to all sessions, workshops, panels, field trips, social events, and interactions within the local community. As a participant in the conference, you represent your organizations and the shared values of our chosen professions. 

###  **Purpose**

The conference is a platform for constructive dialogue, professional exchange, and collaborative engagement, reflecting the shared values of the biodiversity and sustainability communities. We value the diversity of perspectives, backgrounds, and expertise participants bring to the event and aim to create an environment where everyone feels safe, respected, and valued.

### Expectations for Participants

We ask all participants to:

1. **Engage Respectfully**  
   * Treat all individuals with respect, courtesy, and consideration. Recognize power dynamics that extend beyond seniority, including those related to cultural, geographic, linguistic, and educational backgrounds, as well as job status. Senior professionals should be aware of how their status affects interactions with junior attendees. Additionally, session organizers—especially those who may be perceived as lower status—should not be placed at a disadvantage when needing to enforce guidelines, such as ensuring fair use of time for discussion and questions.  
   * Value the diversity of views, opinions, and expertise of conference hosts and participants.  
   * Communicate openly, critiquing ideas rather than individuals and avoiding personal attacks.  
   * Be mindful of cultural norms, including appropriate attire, language, and customs.  
2. **Participate Professionally**  
   * Foster an environment of collaboration and fairness. Approach discussions with an open mind and a willingness to learn from others.  
   * Honor time limits for presentations and discussions. Do not interrupt speakers or participants, and wait to be called on to participate in discussions.  
   * Balance speaking and listening time in group settings, creating space for new and early-career participants to contribute.  
3. **Ensure Accessibility and Transparency**  
   * Cite sources appropriately, including the use of AI-generated text or images, and ensure proper licensing for graphics.  
   * Respect the confidentiality of streamed or recorded conference materials and refrain from unauthorized sharing.

### Unacceptable Behavior

The following behaviors are strictly prohibited:

* **Harassment and Discrimination**: Includes but is not limited to verbal, physical, or written harassment based on gender, ethnicity, religion, sexual orientation, disability, or other characteristics.  
* **Intimidation or Abuse**: Deliberate intimidation, stalking, inappropriate physical contact, or unwelcome attention.  
* **Disruption**: Sustained interruptions of sessions, panels, or other conference activities.  
* **Retaliation**: Any threats or intimidation toward individuals reporting violations of this code or supporting such reports.  
* **Unwanted photography.**

### Enforcement and Reporting

Violations of this Code of Conduct will be addressed at the discretion of the Conference Organizing Committee, potentially in liaison with organizational representatives. Consequences may include:

* Immediate removal from conference activities without refund.  
* Prohibition from future events or forums.  
* Reporting to relevant authorities or employers as necessary.

If you experience or witness harassment, abuse, or any behavior violating this Code of Conduct, please:

* Contact conference staff at the registration desk.  
* Email the organizing team at [ccc@tdwg.org](mailto:ccc@tdwg.org). Reports will be treated confidentially, and all parties involved will be protected from retaliation or further harm.

### **Commitment to Resolution**

The conference organizers will respond to reported incidents promptly, ensuring fairness and confidentiality throughout the process. Both complainants and respondents may appeal decisions to the Conference Organizing Committee, whose judgment will be final.
