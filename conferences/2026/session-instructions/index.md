# Instructions for Session Organisers

## Submissions

In 2026, the TDWG conference will use the Whova platform. Session proposals will be submitted on the platform. You can access the submission system through the [TDWG website conference page](https://www.tdwg.org/conferences/2026/call-for-sessions/).

## Session information required

### Submission tracks

Submission tracks help attendees to tailor their conference to their interests. You can pick one or more tracks for your session.

### Session type

#### Symposium 

A symposium has a series of presentations around a theme or topic. Presenters may take questions from the audience if time allows, and there may or may not be a general discussion included. This is the most common session type chosen. 

#### Session of lightning talks

Lightning talks are usually 5 minutes long. These sessions are rapid-fire, energetic, and fast-moving. They're a great way for presenters to showcase just one idea or result.

#### Workshops

Workshops are hands-on sessions that involve participants learning new skills and working through problems. Workshops may require participants to come prepared, to bring particular equipment, etc.

If you select a Workshop, you will also be asked to specify a preferred duration. You might request a workshop that runs for a single session (90 or 120 minutes) or half or full day. Organisers cannot guarantee that your request will be accommodated. 

#### Discussion sessions

Discussion sessions can take various forms, including an invited panel, a fireside chat format, presentations as pre-recorded videos, followed by an open discussion. 

Please specify in the session description what sort of discussion session format you propose.

#### Unconference

There is usually only one Unconference planned, and if you have a team of people keen to organise it, then please put up your hands\! 

#### Working meeting

TDWG Interest Groups and Task Groups may want to hold a face-to-face working meeting to make progress towards their goal.

### Title

Provide a title for your session in 100 characters or fewer. 

### Session description

Provide a description for your session in approximately 200-250 words / 1500 characters. The session description should provide enough information about the topics to be covered that someone wanting to propose an abstract will know whether their idea will fit the session. Including a statement about what type of abstract topics you hope to attract is helpful. The session description will also be published in the conference program. 

### Open or closed?

For Open sessions, organisers will consider unsolicited abstracts submitted. This is the default option.

For closed sessions, all the presenters are invited by the session organisers. Note that for closed sessions, all presentations must still have an abstract submitted. Workshops and the Unconference are always closed, as the session organisers will run the session. 

## FAQS

### Editing your submission

You can continue to edit your submission until the call for sessions closes.

### Session Duration

Four sessions will run each day. Sessions can be 60, 90, or 120 minutes long. Some symposia that attract a lot of abstracts may run over several sessions.

### Session acceptance process

Once the Call for Sessions closes, each proposal will be assessed. Provisional acceptance of each session into the Call for Abstracts round does not mean that the session will eventually run. The final decision about what sessions run, and their duration, will not be made until after the Call for Abstracts closes. 

### Responsibility of session organisers

Session organisers are responsible for reviewing, approving, and selecting the order of speakers for your session, as relevant. You will need to ensure that you meet deadlines for tasks in order for the conference program to be set. 

If you are inviting presenters for your session, it is your responsibility to ensure that they submit an abstract and register for the conference. 

### Running the session at the conference 

During the conference, you will moderate your session(s). There must be at least two organizers who will be present at the in-person meeting to run the session. **Please note:** ALL session organizers, presenters, and panellists in the session must be registered for the conference.
