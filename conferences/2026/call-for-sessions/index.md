## Call for organized sessions

We invite you to submit a proposal for an organized session at TDWG 2026 that reflects the work that TDWG does and the ways that collections and standards contribute to our understanding and documentation of biodiversity.

We strongly encourage you to consider the conference theme: Research and Robot-ready Biodiversity Data Standards.

Organized sessions types include symposia with either long or lightning talks, discussions, workshops and others.

Sessions may be open or closed to presentation submissions. If you propose a closed session you, as organisers, will be responsible for finding speakers/panellists and ensuring that abstracts are submitted.

Session organisers are also responsible for reviewing, approving and ordering abstracts for your session. During the conference you will moderate your session(s). **At least one session organizer must be registered for the conference and be present, in-person, at the meeting.**

Provisional acceptance of your session proposal at this stage does not guarantee that your session will run. Final decisions about which sessions will or won't run are not made until after the abstract submission and review period has passed.

Calls for abstracts will be announced in mid-March, 2026.

**Submission deadline: 25 February 2026 (close of business in your time zone)**
