We welcome volunteers from all parts of the TDWG community—researchers, practitioners, data professionals, students, and anyone with an interest in conference planning, scholarly communication, or community building.

We are a diverse committee and **strongly encourage applications from people representing different regions, backgrounds, genders, ages, and career stages**. TDWG benefits from a wide range of perspectives, and we value contributions from both new and experienced community members.

Prior experience on a program committee is helpful but not required. What matters most is your willingness to contribute a few hours each week and to participate actively in Program Committee activities.

Serving on the Program Committee offers a range of professional and personal benefits, which may include the opportunity to:

* **Gain hands‑on experience** in planning and delivering an international hybrid conference.
