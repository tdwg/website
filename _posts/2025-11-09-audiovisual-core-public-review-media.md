The Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group has approved a proposal to create a class for media items. This proposal is intended to complement the Darwin Core Data Packages proposal, in addition to serving as a class whose members are the subject of most of the existing terms in Audiovisual Core.

To view the proposal's full details and make comments, visit https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues/277. The comment period will run for at least 30 days, starting on November 10 and ending no earlier than December 10. 

If you have any questions, please contact [Ed Baker](mailto:edward.baker@nhm.ac.uk), Audiovisual Core Maintenance Group convener.
