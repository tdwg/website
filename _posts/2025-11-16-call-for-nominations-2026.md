TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. You would be a member of the TDWG Executive Committee, which oversees the work of TDWG: coordinates TDWG Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the Constitution and detailed further in supplementary documents.

Positions on the Executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the committee will be new in any year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms from 2026 through 2027\. The open positions and their responsibilities are detailed below, followed by the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election.

## General responsibilities

All officers, including Subcommittee Chairs, have voting rights on the Executive Committee, and are expected to participate in the committee’s conference calls, which are generally every two weeks.
