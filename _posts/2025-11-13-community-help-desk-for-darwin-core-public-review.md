### What

Are you curious about the current Darwin Core public review period but not sure how to engage? Meaning to think about it, but need time on the calendar to make it happen? Not sure how to interpret all of the documentation and discussion? Join us for an informal help desk session to orient new participants and answer questions. We will begin with a 10-minute overview of the TDWG public review process (to be recorded), followed by open discussion and Q&A (not recorded). Discover what changes are being suggested, what new terms are being proposed, and how you can share your thoughts!

Note that the current review is more complex than typical Darwin Core change proposals, as it includes a new Conceptual Model and Data Package guide. These proposed changes are intended to support richer, more complex types of biodiversity data than are currently possible with a Darwin Core Archive.
