## Nominations for Deputy Chair

### [Patricia Mergen](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-2848-8231)

Meise Botanic Garden and Africamuseum Tervuren, Belgium

#### Background

I have been active in TDWG since 2002, had the position of Secretary for several turns and am currently chair of the [Time and Place Committee](https://www.tdwg.org/about/committees/tardis/). I have actively participated and managed projects around research infrastructures in the domain of Biodiversity Information and environmentally related topics, as well as in Natural History Collections. I am currently the contact for the Belgian National Task force for the ESFRI proposal [DiSSCo](http://dissco.eu/) (Distributed System of Scientific collections) and as liaison with other infrastructures such as this [e-LTER](http://www.lter-europe.net/), [LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), [DARIAH](http://be.dariah.eu/) and [E-RIHS](http://www.e-rihs.eu/). She is also following up the programs on the [European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eudat.eu/european-open-science-cloud) (EOSC) and [EU-DAT](https://eudat.eu/). I have expertise in Biodiversity Information standards and tools. Active member of the [Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities](https://cetaf.org/) (CETAF) since 2005, sitting in the executive Committee from 2006 to 2015, currently involved as liaison between the different CETAF working groups. I have been involved since 2003 in the infrastructure project SYNTHESYS (Synthesis of Systematic resources) dealing with best practices in collection management and associated data and images.

In my PhD I applied Numerical Ecology, modelling and statistics. I am currently mentor and training provider for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility EU project BID](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82243/bid-biodiversity-information-for-development) (Biodiversity Information for Development) where I am teaching about digitisation, data mobilisation, data cleaning, Geographic Information Systems, Niche modelling and IUCN Red list conservation status determinations and revisions aimed at policy maker users.

#### Vision for TDWG

As deputy chair and subsequently chair of TDWG, I will together with the executive committee and TDWG members, aim at having TDWG’s position reinforced and made more visible in the international biodiversity landscape. Notably the collaboration with GBIF, CETAF, DiSSCo, and other infrastructures will be continued and enhanced. New markets and users for TDWG standards will be identified. The process of ratification of standards will be continuously enhanced and speeded up to broaden the user base and the number of TDWG standards implemented by the communities. With my background and experience in fund raising and project management, I will also contribute to the mobilization of funds for TDWG and for example help with the access to European opportunities via its new European TDWG based branch.

### [Abby Benson](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4391-107X)

United States Geological Survey, Colorado, United States

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have worked for the United States Geological Survey (USGS) since 2010 and I have been the node manager for the US Node to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) since 2015. I also served as co-chair for the Marine Biodata Task Team from 2015 – 2017. My interest is in the drivers and effects of changing ecosystems on organisms at national and global scales and the role management can play in mitigating deleterious effects. Concomitant with that is understanding the patterns of species diversity and how analyses involving data synthesis can expose patterns over broad spatial distributions and longer time scales. Inherit in these interests is the need for biodiversity information to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and biodiversity information standards play a key role in adhering to the FAIR Principles.

#### Vision Statement

TDWG has a unique position within the biodiversity information arena because biodiversity information standards provide the connection point between the people collecting data, managing data, and (re)using data. As such, the power of TDWG rests in making, fostering, and nurturing the connections between these three groups of people. As deputy chair and then chair of TDWG, I hope to identify new connections to cultivate with groups that may be underrepresented within TDWG and bolster collaborations that are already in place. As we invite ideas and critiques from current members and new ones, TDWG will find new avenues and directions to continue building a robust community of biodiversity information enthusiasts.

### Deborah Paul

Florida State University, Tallahassee, FL, USA

#### Background and Vision Statement

I am passionate about working to build bridges between groups and creating environments where all feel welcome. For more than twelve years, I have participated in various biodiversity initiatives. Examples include digitization in the FSU R.K. Godfrey Herbarium, mobilizing data and images for Morphbank, leading digitization and workforce training efforts at iDigBio, collaborating worldwide to develop symposia and workshops, and networking and mentoring to foster biodiversity informatics skills in the collections and research communities. I am an active participant in the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC), Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG), the Entomological Collections Network (ECN), ICEDIG, the Research Data Alliance (RDA), and The Carpentries. 

As Deputy and then Chair, I would continue to strengthen TDWG’s role as a community leader and partner in biodiversity standards development and implementation. Initiating and continuing work with key organizations like ECN, RDA, CODATA, and The Carpentries, helps TDWG develop natural communities to use and contribute to biodiversity standards. Collaboration with GBIF, ALA, VertNet, iDigBio and others is key for testing and implementing TDWG ideas and products. Moreover, we need to work with other standards organizations to learn from them and share our expertise.

We can work together to further the relationship between SPNHC and TDWG started by our first joint meeting. SPNHC and TDWG both publish journals, so a periodic joint issue might help expand the reach of each organization. I envision a TDWG 5-10+ year plan that seeks to include relevant industry/manufacturers as partners and collaborators (e.g. 3D, AI, Google).

Additionally, it would be great to examine membership and choose some strategic goals (e.g. diversity, sustained membership, etc.). Evidence suggests training helps sustain membership, so this could be a potential role for TDWG, beginning by suggesting course/training content through the BDI IG and Community and Outreach group.
Other ideas based on prior TDWG meetings and recent conversations center around meeting structure and the working group process. We could (re)incorporate introductory sessions for new / first time attendees. Others suggest: 1) allowing dedicated work time at future conferences, 2) offering training, 3) bringing back lightning talks, 4) developing a strategy for TDWG IGs and TGs to meet between yearly meetings, and 5) developing a webinar series parallel to Darwin Core Hour to support and facilitate effective community outreach for TDWG groups.

As a TDWG member myself, I most want to support the development of your ideas, and your vision for TDWG. 


## Nominations for Secretary

### [Quentin Groom](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0596-5376)

Meise Botanic Garden, Belgium 

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have broad experience in the plant sciences having originally worked in the UK and USA on the physiology, biophysics and molecular biology of photosynthesis and plant iron metabolism. Now I work in Belgium at [Meise Botanic Garden](http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/index.php) where I work at the interface of biodiversity science and information technology. I am currently part of a team digitizing and disseminating images of the Garden’s four million herbarium specimens. I take every opportunity to encourage data sharing and openness, though I am keen to ensure that data providers are adequately acknowledged and supported. Currently, I am leading the Open Science project [TrIAS](https://osf.io/7dpgr/) to create open workflows for the creation of policy ready information on invasive species from citizen science data. I am also working on the [ICEDIG](https://icedig.eu/) project to prepare for mass digitization and dissemination of museums and herbaria across Europe.

I have a particular research interest in introduced plants, their ecology and biogeography. In this context I am Vice Chair of the [Alien-CSI](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA17122) COST Action towards monitoring and understanding of invasive species with citizen scientists. I am also leading a TDWG Task Group to improve the Darwin Core standard for its use with invasive species data.

#### Vision statement

We live in exciting times for biodiversity informatics, both a time when we have the capability to do more and better science with information technology, but also a time when the global challenges for biodiversity are extreme. Through my work with TDWG I hope to make new science possible and make a significant contribution to protecting our living heritage. Having learned much in my first two years as TDWG Secretary I hope to be even more effective in my role and in promoting TDWG to a wider audience.


## Communications and Outreach FS Chair

### [Prabhakar Rajagopal](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9320-5942)

Strand Life Sciences and Ashoka Trust for Research in Ecology and the Environment (ATREE), Bangalore, India

#### Curriculum Vitae

I did my bachelors in engineering from Indian Institute of Technology, Madras and my PhD from the Indian Institute of Science in Bangalore in the biological sciences. I work in Strand Life Sciences, which is a bioinformatics and computational biology company working in clinical genomics. 

Since 2008, I have been involved in biodiversity informatics and have been working on building the [India Biodiversity Portal](http://indiabiodiversity.org), leading a team of developers within Strand Life Sciences. The platform is now mature, and powers three instances, the India Biodiversity Portal, the WIKWIO portal for the weeds of Africa and the Bhutan Biodiversity Portal.  

#### Vision statement

I have been involved in TDWG since 2014. I would like to build a team from members of TDWG who guide the activities of the outreach and communication sub-committee. The team would address four specific activities: 

- They will create and put together publicity material as digital presentations, pamphlets and flyers for open access and use to all members of TDWG.
- They will help advocate, evangelize and build capacity in biodiversity informatics standards  in stakeholder groups across the world.
- They will work closely with regional representatives, especially in Africa, Asia and South America in building capacity in biodiversity informatics in collaboration with local institutions.
- They will document and report all TDWG conducted and upcoming outreach and communication activities through the newly launched and website for global visibility

## Fundraising and Partnernships FS Chair

### Connie Rinaldo

Librarian of the Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University

#### Background and Curriculum Vitae

I have a BA in Biology and Anthropology from the University of Massachusetts, Boston, an MSc in Zoology from the University of Connecticut and an MLS from the University of Maryland. I began studying for a PhD in Zoology but after a number of twists and turns I ended up as a Systems Analyst for EG&G, Washington Analytical Services, Inc.  From there I become a librarian by completing my MLS at the University of Maryland.  I worked on the National Text Digitizing Project, an early digitization program, at the National Agricultural Library and then moved to Dartmouth College as the Head of Collections in the Biomedical Libraries. I also worked with the Digital Library for Earth Systems Education, analyzing collections.  After Dartmouth, I became the Librarian of the Ernst Mayr Library of the Museum of Comparative Zoology (MCZ), Harvard University, combining my skills as a librarian with opportunities for research partnerships in the MCZ and Biodiversity Heritage Library. As a founding member of the BHL (now Chair of the Executive Committee), I have been instrumental in digitizing the Ernst Mayr Library collections for open access and developing innovative strategic plans for the BHL.  I first attended TDWG in St. Louis in 2006.  I am passionate about natural history and working with local, national and global partners to ensure that biodiversity data in library collections are connected, open and accessible for all. 

#### Vision Statement

The mission for this subcommittee states that “FPFS will work together with TDWG executive committee as well as TDWG task and interest groups to submit and implement competitive funding bids and improve the position of TDWG in the international landscape through strategic partnerships at international, regional, or national level.” These complex and important tasks will require an engaged globally diverse committee from the TDWG membership that can find international opportunities for funding and partnerships. The 2018 New Zealand joint meeting with SPNHC and the upcoming 2019 joint meeting alongside GBIF, CETAF and DiSSCo are excellent examples of the types of partnerships that should be continued and pursued. Engaging European organizations and funders was key. These collaborations with GBIF, CETAF and DiSSCo will present more prospects for shared funding but the FPFS will need to identify and assess new strategic partners and funding opportunities, looking beyond the expected biodiversity organizations, pursuing more corporate partnerships, donors and foundations.   

A long-term vision is to reinforce the visibility of TDWG across the globe, establish strong new alliances and nurture current relationships to secure funding and support.   My key goal for the upcoming year is to establish a strong committee to work with the Executive Committee to reach this vision.

## Nominations for North America representative

### [David Bloom](https://orcid.org/0000-0003-1273-1807)

VertNet, California, United States

#### Curriculum Vitae

I am a member of VertNet (since 2010) as project coordinator, data mobilizer, and data quality specialist. My participation with TDWG has been closely tied to my work with VertNet. I served as a member of iDigBio’s data mobilization team (2016-18). I am the node manager and Head of Delegation for the VertNet node to GBIF, which actively supports global data publishers without organized nodes and activities undertaken by the US Node. I am an active (addicted) mentor for GBIF’s BID Programme and I have supported the efforts of projects in the Caribbean, Africa, and Southern Pacific regions. I have conducted more than 50 workshops globally on biodiversity informatics ranging from georeferencing to data publishing and the use of biodiversity data. My interest is to find, develop, and implement tools, services, and solutions that make the lives of people who work with biodiversity data more productive and efficient. Data should be of the highest quality, easy to find, easy to publish, and easy to use.

#### Vision statement

I believe that TDWG is uniquely positioned to bring the data-wonks and the larger community together to create robust standards and cross-disciplinary programs. As the North American representative I envision a TDWG that is the authority for standards development in biodiversity and is inclusive of the views, needs, and criticism of the people and organizations that use/need the standards. I also want to see TDWG develop into an outward-facing organization that is agile and able to serve the community more efficiently.  In particular, TDWG can serve as an incubator for innovative ideas and a bridge that links active projects with potential funding with the ability to facilitate change in the way that science and policy-making is accomplished and communicated. As I work toward this vision of TDWG I will utilize the broad network I have built in North America (and beyond). I will catalyze communications between TDWG and the practitioners who use data daily to encourage increased participation in the activities of TDWG and generate outcomes that promote solid science and smart policy-making.

### Holly Little

Dept of Paleobiology, National Museum of Natural History, Smithsonian Institution, Washington DC

#### Background

As the Informatics Specialist for the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural History Department of Paleobiology, I am responsible for all aspects of our digital collections, from designing and managing digitization projects to long term preservation and stewardship of our data. This work requires me to maintain a core focus of designing extensible and replicable methods integrated with and based upon the standards of the global community, but adapted to local needs. 

In addition, I am a member of community efforts including Darwin Core Hour, Data Carpentries, the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC), multiple National Science Foundation Advancing the Digitization of Biological Collections program Thematic Collections Networks, Community Standards for 3D Data Preservation (CS3DP), TDWG Paleo Interest Group and Collections Description Interest Group, the iDigBio Paleo Digitization Working Group, and a number of collaborative projects spanning institutional boundaries across North America and the globe. 

My current research is focused on evaluating the landscape of data sharing practices in the paleo community through analysis of occurrence records and datasets in GBIF. I participate in and facilitate discussion on best practices for use of established standards for fossil occurrence data and on development of new terms, vocabularies, and additional tools that may be needed.

#### Vision

It is vital that TDWG actively engage with the individuals, projects, and institutions that utilize and contribute to the standards, best practices, and tools developed and maintained by TDWG. The North American Representative acts as a facilitator of that effort. I look forward to the opportunity to bring TDWG to the community and to bring the community to TDWG. In this role, I will highlight discussions of discipline specific and broader biodiversity community needs, and work towards implementation of TDWG standards and tools across the many projects and initiatives in North America.

A great example of this effort was a workshop I co-convened, at the SPNHC 2017 meeting titled “Biodiversity Informatics 101”. Through community engagement and education we sought to sow the seeds of a grassroots effort to bridge collections community practitioners and standards developers into the same conversation and to provide an opportunity for common knowledge and language, encouraging participation in this work. With these efforts (e.g., workshops, webinars, reaching out to engage in discipline and community discussions), we can engage practitioners, along with members of the community affected by the work of the practitioners or that provide the building blocks from which biodiversity informatics develops.

My experience within the community and engagement in efforts to establish an environment of collaboration and understanding sits within an important intersection of projects and people. As the North America Representative, I will bring new people into TDWG by informing the relevance that they have for TDWG and that TDWG has for them. I will also help to encourage continued progress and innovation for TDWG that remains engaged with, and informed of, the local implementation of our global efforts.
