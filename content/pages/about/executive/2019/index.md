## Nominations for Deputy Chair

### Patricia Mergen

Meise Botanic Garden and Africamuseum Tervuren, Belgium

#### Background

I have been active in TDWG since 2002, had the position of Secretary for several turns and am currently chair of the [Time and Place Committee](https://www.tdwg.org/about/committees/tardis/). I have actively participated and managed projects around research infrastructures in the domain of Biodiversity Information and environmentally related topics, as well as in Natural History Collections. I am currently the contact for the Belgian National Task force for the ESFRI proposal [DiSSCo](http://dissco.eu/) (Distributed System of Scientific collections) and as liaison with other infrastructures such as this [e-LTER](http://www.lter-europe.net/), [LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), [DARIAH](http://be.dariah.eu/) and [E-RIHS](http://www.e-rihs.eu/). She is also following up the programs on the [European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eudat.eu/european-open-science-cloud) (EOSC) and [EU-DAT](https://eudat.eu/). I have expertise in Biodiversity Information standards and tools. Active member of the [Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities](https://cetaf.org/) (CETAF) since 2005, sitting in the executive Committee from 2006 to 2015, currently involved as liaison between the different CETAF working groups. I have been involved since 2003 in the infrastructure project SYNTHESYS (Synthesis of Systematic resources) dealing with best practices in collection management and associated data and images.

In my PhD I applied Numerical Ecology, modelling and statistics. I am currently mentor and training provider for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility EU project BID](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82243/bid-biodiversity-information-for-development) (Biodiversity Information for Development) where I am teaching about digitisation, data mobilisation, data cleaning, Geographic Information Systems, Niche modelling and IUCN Red list conservation status determinations and revisions aimed at policy maker users.

#### Vision for TDWG

As deputy chair and subsequently chair of TDWG, I will together with the executive committee and TDWG members, aim at having TDWG’s position reinforced and made more visible in the international biodiversity landscape. Notably the collaboration with GBIF, CETAF, DiSSCo, and other infrastructures will be continued and enhanced. New markets and users for TDWG standards will be identified. The process of ratification of standards will be continuously enhanced and speeded up to broaden the user base and the number of TDWG standards implemented by the communities. With my background and experience in fund raising and project management, I will also contribute to the mobilization of funds for TDWG and for example help with the access to European opportunities via its new European TDWG based branch.

### Abby Benson

United States Geological Survey, Colorado, United States

#### Curriculum Vitae
I have worked for the United States Geological Survey since 2010 and I have been the node manager for the US Node to the Ocean Biogeographic Information System (OBIS) since 2015. I also served as co-chair for the Marine Biodata Task Team from 2015 – 2017. My interest is in the drivers and effects of changing ecosystems on organisms at national and global scales and the role management can play in mitigating deleterious effects. Concomitant with that is understanding the patterns of species diversity and how analyses involving data synthesis can expose patterns over broad spatial distributions and longer time scales. Inherit in these interests is the need for biodiversity information to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) and biodiversity information standards play a key role in adhering to the FAIR Principles.

#### Vision Statement
TDWG has a unique position within the biodiversity information arena because biodiversity information standards provide the connection point between the people collecting data, managing data, and (re)using data. As such, the power of TDWG rests in making, fostering, and nurturing the connections between these three groups of people. As deputy chair and then chair of TDWG, I hope to identify new connections to cultivate with groups that may be underrepresented within TDWG and bolster collaborations that are already in place. As we invite ideas and critiques from current members and new ones, TDWG will find new avenues and directions to continue building a robust community of biodiversity information enthusiasts.

## Nominations for Secretary

### [Quentin Groom](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0596-5376)

Meise Botanic Garden, Belgium 

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have broad experience in the plant sciences having originally worked in the UK and USA on the physiology, biophysics and molecular biology of photosynthesis and plant iron metabolism. Now I work in Belgium at [Meise Botanic Garden](http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/index.php) where I work at the interface of biodiversity science and information technology. I am currently part of a team digitizing and disseminating images of the Garden’s four million herbarium specimens. I take every opportunity to encourage data sharing and openness, though I am keen to ensure that data providers are adequately acknowledged and supported. Currently, I am leading the Open Science project [TrIAS](https://osf.io/7dpgr/) to create open workflows for the creation of policy ready information on invasive species from citizen science data. I am also working on the [ICEDIG](https://icedig.eu/) project to prepare for mass digitization and dissemination of museums and herbaria across Europe.

I have a particular research interest in introduced plants, their ecology and biogeography. In this context I am Vice Chair of the [Alien-CSI](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA17122) COST Action towards monitoring and understanding of invasive species with citizen scientists. I am also leading a TDWG Task Group to improve the Darwin Core standard for its use with invasive species data.

#### Vision statement

We live in exciting times for biodiversity informatics, both a time when we have the capability to do more and better science with information technology, but also a time when the global challenges for biodiversity are extreme. Through my work with TDWG I hope to make new science possible and make a significant contribution to protecting our living heritage. Having learned much in my first two years as TDWG Secretary I hope to be even more effective in my role and in promoting TDWG to a wider audience.


## Communications and Outreach FS Chair

### [Prabhakar Rajagopal](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-9320-5942)

#### Vision statement

I have been involved in TDWG since 2014. I would like to build a team from members of TDWG who guide the activities of the outreach and communication sub-committee. The team would address four specific activities: 

- They will create and put together publicity material as digital presentations, pamphlets and flyers for open access and use to all members of TDWG.
- They will help advocate, evangelize and build capacity in biodiversity informatics standards  in stakeholder groups across the world.
- They will work closely with regional representatives, especially in Africa, Asia and South America in building capacity in biodiversity informatics in collaboration with local institutions.
- They will document and report all TDWG conducted and upcoming outreach and communication activities through the newly launched and website for global visibility
