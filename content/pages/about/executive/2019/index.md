## Nominations for Deputy Chair

### Patricia Mergen

Meise Botanic Garden and the Africa Museum, Tervuren, Belgium

#### Background

I have been active in TDWG since 2002, had the position of Secretary for several turns and am currently chair of the [Time and Place Committee](https://www.tdwg.org/about/committees/tardis/). I have actively participated and managed projects around research infrastructures in the domain of Biodiversity Information and environmentally related topics, as well as in Natural History Collections. I am currently the contact for the Belgian National Task force for the ESFRI proposal [DiSSCo](http://dissco.eu/) (Distributed System of Scientific collections) and as liaison with other infrastructures such as this [e-LTER](http://www.lter-europe.net/), [LifeWatch](https://www.lifewatch.eu/), [DARIAH](http://be.dariah.eu/) and [E-RIHS](http://www.e-rihs.eu/). She is also following up the programs on the [European Open Science Cloud](https://www.eudat.eu/european-open-science-cloud) (EOSC) and [EU-DAT](https://eudat.eu/). I have expertise in Biodiversity Information standards and tools. Active member of the [Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities](https://cetaf.org/) (CETAF) since 2005, sitting in the executive Committee from 2006 to 2015, currently involved as liaison between the different CETAF working groups. I have been involved since 2003 in the infrastructure project SYNTHESYS (Synthesis of Systematic resources) dealing with best practices in collection management and associated data and images.

In my PhD I applied Numerical Ecology, modelling and statistics. I am currently mentor and training provider for the [Global Biodiversity Information Facility EU project BID](https://www.gbif.org/programme/82243/bid-biodiversity-information-for-development) (Biodiversity Information for Development) where I am teaching about digitisation, data mobilisation, data cleaning, Geographic Information Systems, Niche modelling and IUCN Red list conservation status determinations and revisions aimed at policy maker users.

#### Vision for TDWG

As deputy chair and subsequently chair of TDWG, I will together with the executive committee and TDWG members, aim at having TDWG’s position reinforced and made more visible in the international biodiversity landscape. Notably the collaboration with GBIF, CETAF, DiSSCo, and other infrastructures will be continued and enhanced. New markets and users for TDWG standards will be identified. The process of ratification of standards will be continuously enhanced and speeded up to broaden the user base and the number of TDWG standards implemented by the communities. With my background and experience in fund raising and project management, I will also contribute to the mobilization of funds for TDWG and for example help with the access to European opportunities via its new European TDWG based branch.  

## Nominations for Secretary

### [Quentin Groom](https://orcid.org/0000-0002-0596-5376)

Meise Botanic Garden, Belgium 

#### Curriculum Vitae

I have broad experience in the plant sciences having originally worked in the UK and USA on the physiology, biophysics and molecular biology of photosynthesis and plant iron metabolism. Now I work in Belgium at [Meise Botanic Garden](http://www.plantentuinmeise.be/index.php) where I work at the interface of biodiversity science and information technology. I am currently part of a team digitizing and disseminating images of the Garden’s four million herbarium specimens. I take every opportunity to encourage data sharing and openness, though I am keen to ensure that data providers are adequately acknowledged and supported. Currently, I am leading the Open Science project [TrIAS](https://osf.io/7dpgr/) to create open workflows for the creation of policy ready information on invasive species from citizen science data. I am also working on the [ICEDIG](https://icedig.eu/) project to prepare for mass digitization and dissemination of museums and herbaria across Europe.

I have a particular research interest in introduced plants, their ecology and biogeography. In this context I am Vice Chair of the [Alien-CSI](http://www.cost.eu/COST_Actions/ca/CA17122) COST Action towards monitoring and understanding of invasive species with citizen scientists. I am also leading a TDWG Task Group to improve the Darwin Core standard for its use with invasive species data.

#### Vision statement

We live in exciting times for biodiversity informatics, both a time when we have the capability to do more and better science with information technology, but also a time when the global challenges for biodiversity are extreme. Through my work with TDWG I hope to make new science possible and make a significant contribution to protecting our living heritage. Having learned much in my first two years as TDWG Secretary I hope to be even more effective in my role and in promoting TDWG to a wider audience.
