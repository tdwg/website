### Overview and Motivation

As an organization with origins in taxonomic classification, TDWG
membership has long been dominated by biological research, informatics,
and collections professionals. The result is a natural tendency toward
areas of growth associated with knowledge domains that overlap with
biology (e.g., ichthyology, herpetology, paleontology) and a community
deficient in specific subject areas such as mineralogy. Identifying
these knowledge gaps and taking direct action to address them is
critical to the continued growth of the TDWG community.

To explore specific areas of interest identified by the community, such
as subject matter expansion, TDWG created community-led interest groups
such as the Earth Sciences and Paleobiology (ESP) interest group. The
core function of this group is to facilitate the use of Darwin Core
across an array of earth sciences, including geology,
chronostratigraphy, mineralogy, paleontology, paleobiology,
zooarchaeology, and paleoanthropology.

Following the membership rends of the wider TDWG community, most ESP 
interest group participants are members of the paleontological community. 
The result is a set of priorities and subsequent discussions that 
naturally learn toward topics related to paleontology and paleontological 
collections. If the ESP interest group is to continue progress toward
achieving its comprehensive goal of extending support to all earth 
sciences, specifically those with minimal biological overlap such as 
mineralogy and petrology, these deficits in community expertise must 
be identified and addressed through task groups, targeted and concerted 
efforts within the scope of a parent interest group. 

### Motivation

The formation of the Mineralogy Extension task group is motivated by 
the need to extend the support of the Darwin Core Archive and TDWG 
community to Mineralogy, an earth sciences field conceptually foreign 
to biological and paleontological collections. The system and techniques 
used to classify mineralogical specimens are prime examples of this 
semantic disconnect. Specimens in biological and paleontological collections 
share a hierarchical classification system with a classic Linnaean origin. 
The result is a common hierarchical data structure for grouping specimens. 
In contrast, the classification of specimens in mineralogical collections 
is based on one of two partially hierarchical independent systems,, the 
Dana <sup>\[1\]</sup> and Nickel Strunz <sup>\[2\]</sup> classification 
systems. The traditional mechanisms and vocabularies have limited applicability 
to the field of mineralogy, which calls for special consideration in the form 
of a task group.

Given its narrower scope and shared knowledge domain, the
Mineralogy Extension effort will reside under the 'parent' ESP interest group. 
Furthermore, the task group will follow the practices established by the existing 
inventory of ESP task groups that include the [Darwin Core Chronometric Age
Extension](https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/chrono/) and [Extension
for Geosciences (EFG)](https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/efg/).

### Phases

The task group will operate in two primary phases. The first involves
recruiting new members in disciplines underrepresented in TDWG. The
task group is the ideal mechanism to facilitate community expansion by
providing collective purpose and structure. Once a recruitment effort
is complete, the second phase begins. The newly formed collection of
subject matter experts will develop a supplemental extension to the
Darwin Core to support the needs of the mineralogical collections
community.

### Goals, Outputs, and Outcomes

The Mineralogy Extension task group plans to adopt a similar
set of goals, outputs, and outcomes with the two existing ESP task
groups, the Darwin Core Chronometric Age Extension and Extension for
Geosciences (EFG) <sup>\[3\]</sup>. These are:

1. Establish a formal set of terms and definitions for mineralogical
collections at the specimen level following the Darwin Core model
and the best practices of previous successful task groups within
TDWG.

2. Provide a crosswalk between the Mineralogy Extension and the 
[EFG standard](https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/efg/)
<sup>\[3\]</sup> that leverages the Simple Knowledge Organization
System (SKOS) schema <sup>\[4\]</sup> to describe the conceptual
similarities between the two standards (e.g., narrowMatch,
exactMatch, closeMatch, etc.).

3. Develop a supplemental specification that extends the existing
Darwin Core Archive to provide direct support for mineralogical
collections.

4. Author a Quick Reference Guide for the Mineralogical Collections
Extension that follows the current Darwin Core Quick Reference
information model.

### Community

Although not a primary goal, we hope that the effort to expand the
participatory body in TDWG can be used as a successful model to assist
community expansion in the future.

### Strategy

1. Create a GitHub repository for the task group to assure adoption of
best practices for the development of TDWG standards and successful 
submission of final deliverables to the TDWG leadership and community 
for review. The repository configuration and function will follow 
existing TDWG practices.

2. Survey the current inventory of data standardization efforts (classification 
hierarchies, controlled vocabularies, schemas, etc.) in the mineralogical and 
related collections communities.

3. Finalize a vocabulary at the specimen-level (in contrast to the
collection or institutional level) through community deliberation
and consensus within the task group, the parent ESP Interest
Group, and the wider TDWG community.

4. In adherence to guidelines in the TDWG Standards Documentation
Standard (SDS), submit final deliverables (see *Deliverables*
section below) for review in accordance with TDWG by-laws
([https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/](https://www.tdwg.org/about/process/)
for the ratification of standards.

*All results from surveys/assessments/solicitations listed above will be
published to the task force GitHub Repository with any required
supplemental/supporting documentation.*

### Deliverables

The final deliverables of the task group include:

1. A formal set of terms and definitions for mineralogy collections
within the Darwin Core architecture in multiple forms, including a
standard TDWG documentation deliverable (TDWG SDS) and a quick
reference guide

2. A supplemental extension schema to the existing Darwin Core
Archive for mineralogical collections

3. A schema crosswalk between the Mineralogy Extension
and EFG standard using the SKOS schema to describe conceptual
differences between individual terms.

### Becoming Involved

This task group welcomes anyone interested in mineralogical, geological,
or petrological collections and/or data standardization efforts. We
encourage parties interested in participating to contribute to the task
group GitHub repository. Using the above contact information, they may
also contact the task group convener, Ben Norton.

### Future Extension

Minerals are naturally occurring, inorganic chemical compounds that form
the building blocks of rocks. This compositional relationship between
rocks and minerals can be extrapolated to formulate a strategy for
tackling complex problems by breaking them into smaller, more manageable
components. We view this task group as the first step toward a larger
goal of tackling geology comprehensively. Furthermore, we fully
anticipate the deliverables created in this task group to be used as a
model for future efforts to tackle other areas within the earth
sciences, such as petrology and meteoritics.

The full scope of our digitized scientific collections, including
geology, ichthyology, herpetology, malacology, mineralogy, and
paleontology is required to achieve a higher level understanding of the
interconnections and patterns that define our natural world. A critical
component to reaching this long-term goal is establishing a common
digital language. As the flagship organization for the standardization
of collections data standards, we hope this task force furthers this
global effort by extending the work of TDWG into currently unoccupied
scientific collections spaces.

### Summary

To extend the scope of the TDWG community beyond biology and
biological-related knowledge domains, targeted efforts in the form of
specialized task groups within the existing TDWG architecture are
needed. Within the scope of the ESP interest group, the field of
mineralogy is an outlier relative to its paleontological counterpart in
terms overlap with biology. As a result, mineralogical collections lack
support from the TDWG community and the Darwin Core archive. By
expanding TDWG membership to the mineralogical collections community and
developing a supplemental extension to the existing Darwin Core Archive
for mineralogical collections, the Mineralogy Extension
task group will bring mineralogy under the TDWG "umbrella" thereby
resolving an identified gap in support to the scientific collections
community. This effort will strengthen the TDWG community with a new
pool of knowledge and provide the foundation for future efforts by the
ESP interest group to extend the Darwin Core standard across all
geoscientific fields.
