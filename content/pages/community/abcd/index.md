## Motivation

The purpose of the ABCD Content Definition Group is to foster
accessibility of existing and emerging biological collection data banks
at the international level by developing and maintaining a comprehensive
and commented schema for biological collection records (ABCD Schema).

ABCD Schema is a common data specification for biological collection
units, including living and preserved specimens, along with field
observations that did not produce voucher specimens. It is intended to
support the exchange and integration of detailed primary collection and
observation data.

All of the world's biological collections contain a number of data items
including specimen-specific (e.g. taxon, altitude, sex) and
collection-specific (e.g. holding institution) elements. The set of
elements used varies from collection to collection. ABCD provides a
reconciled set of element names and their definition for scientists and
curators to use.

A design goal of the data specification was to be both comprehensive and
general, to include a broad array of concepts that might be available in
a collection database, but to mandate only the bare minimum of elements
required to make the specification functional. It is not expected (or
even possible) for any collection to use more than a fraction of the
elements defined in the standard.

ABCD deliberately does not cover taxonomic data, such as synonymy, other
than the use of names in identifications. Likewise, taxon-related
information, such as distribution range, indicator values, etc., is not
included. The elements and concepts that are used provide as much
compatibility as is possible with other standards in the field of
biological collection data, such as HISPID, Darwin Core, and others.

The data specification is cast as an XML schema.

## Goals, Outputs and Outcomes

  - September 2007: Version 2.06c (minor upgrade) published
  - September 2007: All documentation including those produced by the
    TDWG Subgroup on Biological Collection Data moved to TDWG website
  - Medium and long-term: dissolving ABCD into standardised modules that
    map to the TDWG Ontology and can be used by different standards

## Strategy

  - Incremental updates of the existing standard will follow a RfC
    (Request for Comment) process in the task group.
  - The elements in the Schema should be mapped into the TDWG (LSID)
    Ontology. Groups of common data elements should be identified among
    TDWG standards and shared as common modules (e.g. schemas).

## History and Context

See <http://wiki.tdwg.org/twiki/bin/view/ABCD/AbcdIntroduction> _this wiki decommissioned many years ago_.

## Summary

The purpose of the ABCD Task Group is to foster accessibility of
existing and emerging biological collection data banks at the
international level by developing and maintaining a comprehensive and
commented schema for biological collection records (ABCD Schema). In the
process, it promotes standardization of the terminology used to model
biological collection information and provides a general format for data
exchange and retrieval for biological collections.
