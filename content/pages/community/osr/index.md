## Summary

Most primary biodiversity data is based on observational data, which consists of observer-derived measurements of organisms in the environment, or specimens collected in the environment and stored within Natural History collections. There is sufficient overlap in the information stored in observational data and specimen records to allow existing data standards to integrate these data types. However, specific data types have unique requirements that need to be addressed. The purpose of this Interest Group is to explore concepts and methods of biodiversity data description, integration and transfer that fully integrate specimen and observational data into existing data exchange schemas.
