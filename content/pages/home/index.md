Historically known as the Taxonomic Databases Working Group, today's Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) is a not-for-profit, scientific and educational association formed to establish international collaboration among the creators, managers and users of biodiversity information and to promote the wider and more effective dissemination and sharing of knowledge about the world's heritage of biological organisms.

To achieve its goals, TDWG:

- develops, adopts and promotes standards and guidelines for the recording and exchange of data about organisms
- promotes the use of these standards and guidelines through the most appropriate and effective means
- acts as a community forum for discussion through meetings, online discussions, and publications.

See the [About]({filename}../about/index.md) section to learn how TDWG operates and how you can participate. Active Interest Groups are described under [Community]({filename}../community/index.md).
