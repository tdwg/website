# TDWG November 2022, Working Sessions 

TDWG will host working sessions of the Interest and Task Groups (IG/TG) during the week of 7-10 November. These sessions will be hosted in Zoom by TDWG and be free but require registration.


Working sessions will include introductions, overviews of IG/TG use cases, solutions, collaboration resources, and current work practices. The sessions will be interactive, with the participants being able to see each other and raise hands to interact with the conveners, speakers and other participants. 


Below you can find the list of sessions of the respective Interest Groups and Task Groups, and Functional Subcomittees.


# Schedule
The latest schedule has been posted as a Google spreadsheet. See the [TDWG 2022 November Working Sessions Schedule](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1pX24tUL52zPZFv9_GzWAho-5LcMa1AhJe3710q4_8cU/edit?usp=sharing). Three time zones are listed for start times of each session. The sessions are listed below in temporal order and each session has a link that will show the time in your local time zone.

Time zone differences across our global community make it unavoidable that some sessions of interest may occur well outside of normal working hours or during the middle of the night for some.

Each session will be recorded and made available for later viewing. Session organizers are encouraged to use shared notes to enable asynchronous participation. Links will be added to the descriptions below after the live session. 

# Registration and how to support the conference
[Registration is available through Zoom](https://us06web.zoom.us/meeting/register/tZYrf-2pqj8jH9PST-k6ZmZWTPecwjSejmgf). Registration is required to participate in the online event, but it is free. A single registration will allow you to attend any of the sessions. When you register, please answer "Yes" for any meetings you will attend. This is not binding, but will give the meeting organizers an idea of how many to expect. (You do not need to answer "No" for meetings you are not planning to attend.)

The services required to run an online conference, however, are not free. We encourage all participants to [become TDWG members](https://www.tdwg.org/about/membership/) either as individuals or through their institution.

**Organizer:** [Jenn Yost](mailto:Jyost@calpoly.edu), California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, CA, USA

**About the group:** The Plant Phenology Task Group aims to develop a plant phenology extension for the Darwin Core. We will create fields into which plant phenological data can be entered and recommend a standardized vocabulary for use in these fields, drawing heavily from the Plant Phenology Ontology.


## Humboldt Extension to Darwin Core Task Group
**Date/Time:** November 9, 13:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Humboldt+Extension+to+Darwin+Core+Task+Group&iso=20221109T13&p1=%3A&ah=1))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizer:** [Yanina Sica](mailto:yanina.sica@yale.edu), Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA

**About this group:** This task group will explore concepts and methods of species inventories to fully integrate this type of observational data into existing data exchange schemas. Eventually the work will be developed into an extension to Darwin Core. 


## GeoSchemes (Terrestrial Domain) Interest Group
**Date/Time:** November 9, 15:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=GeoSchemes+%28Terrestrial+Domain%29&iso=20221109T15&p1=%3A&am=30))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizer:** [Francisco Pando](mailto:pando@rjb.csic.es), Real Jardín Botánico-CSIC / GBIF Spain, Madrid, Spain

**About the group:** The current version of the standard was published more than 20 year ago. The previous edition was limited to the terrestrial domain and restricted to plants. The current developments, aiming to cover the marine domain and extend to all living organisms, may attract an ever more extended community of uses.


## Plinian Core Task Group
**Date/Time:** November 9, 17:00 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Plinian+Core+Task+Group&iso=20221109T17&p1=%3A&ah=1))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizer:** [Francisco Pando](mailto:pando@rjb.csic.es), Real Jardín Botánico-CSIC / GBIF Spain, Madrid, Spain

**About the group:** This group works towards developing a data specification, the Plinian Core, that can be used to describe different aspects of biological species information. By "biological species information" all kinds of properties or traits related to taxa, including biological and non-biological traits are within scope. 


## Taxon Concepts Schema Interest Group (TCS2)
**Date/Time:** November 9, 22:30 UTC ([Convert to your time zone](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Taxon+Concepts+Schema+Interest+Group+%28TCS2%29&iso=20221109T2230&p1=%3A&ah=1&am=30))

**Session Type:** Interest/Task Group meeting

**Organizer:** [Elspeth Haston](mailto:ehaston@rbge.org.uk), Royal Botanical Gardens Edinburgh (RBGE), Edinburgh, UK

**About the group:** Inspired by the idea of 'minimum information standards' adopted in other areas of biology we name this proposed TDWG standard as 'Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen' (MIDS). This harmonizing framework includes making the data publicly available because pen access policies in countries around the world require that digital data should be findable and accessible, even at the lowest level of available digitized information.
