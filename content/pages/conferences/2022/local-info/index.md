## About Sofia

Sofia is the capital and largest city of Bulgaria.  Situated in the very heart of the Balkan peninsula, it is one of Europe’s oldest cities. It has by far the most dynamic cultural life in the country and offers a large variety of activities.

Sofia is no grand metropolis, but it's a modern, youthful city, with a scattering of onion-domed churches, Ottoman mosques and relic Red Army monuments that lend an eclectic, exotic feel. Excavation work carried out during construction of the metro unveiled a treasure trove of Roman ruins from nearly 2000 years ago, when the city was called 'Serdica'. Away from the buildings and boulevards, vast parks and manicured gardens offer a welcome respite, and the ski slopes and hiking trails of mighty Vitosha mountain are just a short bus ride from the centre. Home to many of Bulgaria's finest museums, galleries, restaurants and clubs, Sofia may persuade you to stick around and explore further.

### Handy phrases

Bulgarians are warm and friendly to foreigners but if you want to break the ice and bring a smile to their faces, learn a few words in Bulgarian before leaving home. _Hint: listen to the pronounciation in Google Translate and practice!_

  - **Dobar den!** ([Добър ден](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B1%D1%8A%D1%80%20%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BD&op=translate)!/Doh-bur dehn!)
Meaning: “Hello!” in the local language is always a great start no matter where in the world you are.
  - **Blagodarya!** ([Благодаря](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%91%D0%BB%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0%D1%80%D1%8F%0A&op=translate)!/Blah-goh-da-rya!)
Meaning: “Thank you!” in Bulgarian requires quite an effort to pronounce but you’ll be rewarded with a big, genuine smile when you do. Another, more casual word for “thank you” is the French “Merci”, which is very widely used and it’s easier to remember. You can use both.
  - **Dovijdane!** ([Довиждане](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%94%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B6%D0%B4%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%B5&op=translate)!/Doh-veezh-dah-nay!)
Meaning: “Goodbye” is another long and tongue-twisting word and again you have an easier option. Bulgarians use the Italian “Ciao” as a more informal equivalent.
  - **Izvinete!** ([Извинете](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%98%D0%B7%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82%D0%B5&op=translate)/Eez-vee-neh-teh)
Meaning: “Excuse me”. You might need this word if you happen to use the public transportation in rush hour and have to get to the door to get off. Just keep on repeating “Izvinete, izvinete” while pushing your way to the door.
  - **Nazdrave!** ([Наздраве](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%9D%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B4%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%B5&op=translate)!/Naz-drah-veh!)
Meaning: In Bulgarian they use the same word for “Cheers” when drinking and for “Bless you” when you sneeze. It literally means “To your health!”, or “Be healthy”. Remember that in Bulgaria, it’s not acceptable to say “Cheers” if you’re not drinking alcohol.
  - **Edna golyama bira/rakia, molya!** ([Една голяма бира/ракия, моля](https://translate.google.com/?hl=en&sl=bg&tl=en&text=%D0%95%D0%B4%D0%BD%D0%B0%20%D0%B3%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F%D0%BC%D0%B0%20%D0%B1%D0%B8%D1%80%D0%B0%2F%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B8%D1%8F%2C%20%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8F&op=translate)!/Eh-dna goh-lya-ma rah-kiya beera moh-lya)
Meaning: “One big beer/rakia, please!”. All the alcohol names are the same or very similar to English, so you’ll find it easy to compile a sentence. If you don’t have time to learn the numbers, use your fingers, it’s a universal language. Rakiya is our national strong drink, similar to the Italian “grapa” (if produced from grape), however other famous blends of it are “Slivova” (plum rakia), or “Kaisieva” (apricot rakia).
