# The Program Committee for TDWG 2021

Meeting regularly on Zoom, Slack, and collaborating on Google Drive throughout 2021 from all over the world, the #TDWG2021PrgmCmte is fueled by volunteers who have called for session organizers; solicited, reviewed, and edited abstracts; explored spaces for virtual social networking; and worked on scheduling events. Some wear multiple hats; some are veterans of conference planning, others are new to the process, but all learn something new, have the chance to take a leadership role on a team, and to meet and work with new colleagues and friends.

  As the head of BIRD, Theary's role is to assist researchers in their development projects in Biodiversity Informatics including looking for funding opportunities, helping define and write their specifications, hiring personnel and managing their projects on a daily basis.
Her research is focussed on applying comparative biogeography methods to different regions of the globe with a special interest in Southeast Asia and the West Pacific region. Because she is very much interested in standardisation and interoperability, she is developing an ontology for biogeographic areas, which will facilitate their use.
She serves as Secretary for Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG).
