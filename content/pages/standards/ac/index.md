# AudubonCore (AC)

The Audubon Core (AC) is a set of vocabularies designed to represent metadata for biodiversity multimedia resources and collections. These vocabularies aim to represent information that will help to determine whether a particular resource or collection will be fit for some particular biodiversity science application before acquiring the media. Among others, the vocabularies address such concerns as the management of the media and collections, descriptions of their content, their taxonomic, geographic, and temporal coverage, and the appropriate ways to retrieve, attribute and reproduce them.

## The Audubon Core Maintenance Group

Audubon Core is maintained by a specialized [Interest Group](http://www.tdwg.org/about-tdwg/process/) whose [charter](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/blob/master/audubon-core_maintenance-group_charter.md) was approved in January 2018. The functions of the Audubon Core Maintenance Group are described in detail in [Section 2 of the TDWG Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md#2-administration). In brief, the Maintenance Group manages vocabulary term additions and changes, and maintains the documentation that helps users to understand and apply the standard. As an Interest Group, it may establish Task Groups to accomplish broader changes to the standard. 

## Core Members of the AC Maintenance Group

Currently, core members of the group are:

Steve Baskauf - Vanderbilt University Department of Biological Sciences (Convener) - [steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu)

Robert A. Morris - University of Massachusetts, Boston - [morris.bob@gmail.com](mailto:morris.bob@gmail.com)

Douglas Boyer -Department of Evolutionary Anthropology, Duke University, Director of MorphoSource open access 3D repository - [douglasmb@gmail.com](mailto:douglasmb@gmail.com)

Niels Klazenga - Royal Botanic Gardens Victoria - [Niels.Klazenga@rbg.vic.gov.au](mailto:Niels.Klazenga@rbg.vic.gov.au)

## Participating in the Group

If you would like to participate in this group, contact the convener or one of the core members. 

To participate in the communication system of the group, "watch" the group's [Issues tracker](https://github.com/tdwg/ac/issues). This issues tracker is the mechanism for suggesting specific changes to the standard as well as to raise issues for discussion by the group.
