Nominations are open for positions on the [Executive Committee](/about/executive/) of Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG) for terms spanning 2026-2027.

This is an opportunity to lead the development of biodiversity informatics and work with an enthusiastic team to improve the quality and interoperability of biodiversity data.

TDWG is an international organization that promotes the digitization, integration, and sharing of information about the world’s biodiversity. TDWG provides a forum where individuals, projects, and institutions who manage biodiversity data can come together to share expertise and promote interoperability by promulgating standards and best practices. TDWG also publishes the Biodiversity Information Science and Standards (BISS) journal where papers on issues related to information technology and biodiversity science can be published. The TDWG Executive Committee oversees the work of TDWG. It coordinates TDWG's Interest and Task Groups, manages the review and ratification of standards, manages the organization’s journal, and organizes the annual meeting. These responsibilities are set forth in the [Constitution](/about/constitution/) and detailed further in a [supplementary document](/about/executive/responsibilities/).

Positions on the executive are staggered two-year terms, such that no more than half of the Committee will be new each year. Towards the end of every calendar year, TDWG holds elections for terms that are expiring and need to be filled for the coming year. Officers elected this year will serve terms in the caledar years 2026 and 2027. The the schedule and procedures for nominations and the election are detailed below, followed by open positions, their responsibilities, and nominees.

## Nomination procedure

To nominate someone for one of the positions above, first confirm that the nominee is willing to accept the responsibilities of the office. Then work with the nominee to send a brief statement of the nominee’s background and vision (approximately 400 words) to the [TDWG Secretary](mailto:secretary@tdwg.org). Self nominations are accepted. All nominations must be complete and received before **6 December 2025**.

## Election procedure

The TDWG Secretariat will post the names of nominees below with their statements background and vision. Shortly after nominations are closed, the Secretariat will distribute ballots to all institutional and individual members in good standing. In the case of institutional members, we will notify the primary and secondary contacts, but only one ballot response will be accepted. If you are uncertain about your membership status, please inquire with the TDWG Treasurer (<treasurer@tdwg.org>). Institutional ballots will be weighted as five individual ballots.

## General responsibilities

All officers, including subcommittee chairs, have voting rights on the Executive Committee, and are expected to participate in the Committee’s conference calls, which usually last one hour twice a month. Executive Committee members are expected to find their own support to attend the annual conference.

## Offices open for election

All officers elected this year will serve a term of two calendar years, 2026-2027, except the Deputy Chair, who will serve an additional two years as Chair.

The nominations received until now (1 Dec) are listed below under the respective role. **The nominating period does not close until 6 December.**

### Deputy Chair

[Responsibilities](/about/executive/responsibilities/#deputy-chair) (serves as Deputy Chair 2026-2027, then as Chair 2027-2028)

_Two nominations pending._

<!--
### Secretary

[Responsibilities](/about/executive/responsibilities/#secretary)

#### Visotheary Ung 
_Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris_

**Background**
: I am a biologist by training, I have a masters degree in population genetics but started my professional career at the CNRS (French national center of scientific research) working as a network and systems administrator for 7 years. In 2007, I came back to my first love in science: Systematics, and in 2008 started to attend TDWG meetings as the scientific communication officer for the Xper research group in Paris. In that role, I had the chance to be involved in European projects (EDIT and ViBRANT) which showed me that collaborative work is the key to success. At the same time, I started a PhD on Southeast Asian biogeography and methodology for comparative biogeography which I defended in 2013. I am now a biodiversity informatics project manager and biogeographer based at the Muséum National d’Histoire Naturelle in Paris.
: I am French and grew up in Paris, but was born in Phnom-Penh (Cambodia). I am very proud of my dual culture, which I see as a richness and I am convinced of its good influence on me. Being part of two different cultures, two different worlds has taught me that it is always possible to build bridges, to bring people together. This is exactly what TDWG is about: to bring together biologists, scientists and developers with the purpose of providing the whole community with standards, best practices and tools.

**Vision**
: My first TDWG meeting was in 2008 in Fremantle and I have not missed one ever since. I am thrilled to be more involved in TDWG activities. As Secretary, I will focus on maintaining good communications within our community: among the Executive Committee, members of TDWG Interest and Task Groups and users of TDWG standards.
: I see my role as a connecting hub between everyone, providing clear communication about our processes (creation and use of TDWG standards) and documentation. I have a will to support all members of the Executive Committee, especially our chair and hope to be a good proxy.
: I strongly believe that standards are essential to improve biodiversity data sharing and implementing interoperability of software and systems. TDWG standards have been key to my own research and I will continue pushing forward their use within my research community, locally at the Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle and on a larger scale to the French scientific community.

### Treasurer

[Responsibilities](/about/executive/responsibilities/#treasurer)

#### Chandra Earl
_National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON), Arizona State University, USA (residing in Maryland)_

**Background**
: I currently work as a biodiversity informatician for the [U.S. National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON)](https://www.neonscience.org/) and primary software developer for the [NEON Biorepository](https://biorepo.neonscience.org/) portal, ensuring implementation of FAIR principles in data management, quality, integration and access of NEON biodiversity and sample data. In previous lives, I’ve held a consultancy contract with [OBIS](https://obis.org/) as an eDNA scientific officer and held the Joshua M. Copus Memorial Fellowship at the [Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum](https://www.bishopmuseum.org/) in Honolulu, Hawai‘i.
: I received my graduate degree in [Genetics & Genomics](http://ufgi.ufl.edu/) from the University of Florida, where my dissertation research focused on building tools for “big data” biodiversity analyses, specifically genomics, machine learning and diversification metrices. Due to this, I maintain an ongoing Research Affiliation with the [Florida Museum of Natural History](https://www.floridamuseum.ufl.edu/).
: The theme of my personal research is focused on large-scale biodiversity data and analyses using natural history collections and as such I have broad experiences with developing pipelines for phylogenetics, bioinformatics, machine learning, geographic modelling, and digitized specimen mobilization. I enjoy research collaboration and have contributed to various biodiversity initiatives spanning across taxonomic scales, including insects, mollusks, plants, mammals and fish. One day I’ll get to birds and herps….maybe.

**Vision**
: Although I’m an acting member of a handful of professional societies, biodiversity information is ‘home’. As Treasurer of TDWG, I aim to use my experience within TDWG and connections with other societies to establish a transparent, efficient, and sustainable financial framework that ensures TDWG’s long-term success. I am keen on seeing TDWG evolve into an organization with solid financial health through strategic partnerships, grants, and fundraising, ensuring that we can continue to grow and support all members of the community.

### Technical Architecture Group, Chair (serving 2026-2027)
[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tag/#responsibilities)

**Ben Norton** - _Independent; Raleigh, NC, USA_

<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0002-5819-9134"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px;" alt="ORCID logo" src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> 0000-0002-5819-9134</a>

**Background**

As a dedicated, mission-driven, and determined individual, leading efforts that turn ideas into realities through technology has been a central theme of my career since the very beginning. The Technical Architecture Group chair position is at the apex of this endeavor. The TAG is an engine of progress, ingenuity, and support that impacts activities across the TDWG organization. The opportunities to extend this pivotal role are immense. 

Over the past 15 years, I have chartered an Interdisciplinary and multi-functional career path at the intersection of science and technology. Today, this pathway has materialized into an extensive technical skill set with domain expertise in several scientific fields in both an academic and professional capacity. I’ve built dozens of data-driven, web-based technologies across numerous scientific disciplines, including online search portals, data publishing platforms, and small and large-scale collections management systems. 

In 2020, I became an active member of TDWG. Three years later, I’m the current deputy chair of the Technical Architecture Group, co-convener of the Mineralogy Extension Task Group, review manager of Latimer Core, and contributor to Minimum Information about a Digital Specimen (MIDS) and Camtrap DP. I’ve had the honor of publishing best practices guides, presenting and hosting symposiums at annual conferences, and providing technical guidance to efforts across the organization. In collaboration with the current TAG chair, I’m developing tools to streamline the publication of standards documentation in tandem with the existing RDF TDWG workflow. This effort has immense potential to improve the organization's operations for years.

**Vision**

I envision a more significant and strategic support role for TAG with a prioritization of the following ongoing efforts:

1.  Assure that the work initiated and led by the current chair continues and, where possible, see the activity through to completion.
2.  Expand the TDWG Technical Recommendations, beginning with two best practice guides that address the use of complex values and SKOS mappings in data standards.
3.  Deploy an automated tool for generating web-based standards documentation that operates in tandem with the current RDF workflow.
4.  Develop a strategy to provide targeted support to individual Task and Interest Groups within the current confines of TAG member obligations.
5.  Complete the reorganization of current and past data standards under the stewardship of TDWG.
6.  Continue to broaden and diversify TDWG membership, focusing on underrepresented populations and gaps in domain expertise.

{:id="infrastructure"}
### Infrastructure, Chair (serving 2026-2027)
[Responsibilities](/about/committees/infrastructure/#responsibilities)

**Tim Robertson** - _Global Biodiversity Information Facility Secretariat, Copenhagen, Denmark_

<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0001-6215-3617"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px;" alt="ORCID logo" src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> 0000-0001-6215-3617</a>

**Background**

I currently act as the chair for the Subcommittee for Infrastructure and – along with the members of the group – wrote the current mission and responsibilities of the group which I believe are still relevant.

During my time leading this group we have reworked the TDWG website and assisted TDWG in reorganizing its activities to make maximum use of GitHub.

I am Deputy Director and Head of Informatics at the GBIF Secretariat, and we accommodate TDWG needs within the role of our team which includes the operation and updating of mailing lists, websites etc.

**A (deliberately modest) vision** 

The TDWG community require a stable and simple infrastructure that is intuitive to use. The recent adoption of GitHub for the working groups and website content, along with the mailing lists, tools for conference registration and our journal partnership are – in my opinion – the correct level of infrastructure for TDWG to operate effectively. I see the current role of the committee to continue ensuring the existing processes operate smoothly and be ready to explore emerging needs, but do not see it necessary to make significant changes at this point.

{:id="fundraising"}
### Fundraising and Partnerships, Chair (serving 2026-2027)
[Responsibilities](/about/committees/fundraising/#responsibilities)

**Patricia Mergen** - _Botanical Garden, Meise, Belgium_ 

**Background** 

I have been involved with TDWG since 2002 and acted in the past as representative for Europe, as Secretary, and later on as chair of the Time and Place Committee.

In my respective institutions I work as liaison officer with main tasks being fundraising, project management and networking in the domain of biodiversity information, collections, and data management.

**Vision**

I will bring in members from the different continents with similar roles into the functional subcommittee committee and liaise closely with the regional representatives as well as with the subcommittee on Communication and Outreach and with the TDWG interest groups and task groups.

We will identify the needs of TDWG in terms of funding and collect suggestions for engaging in more formal partnerships agreements with other associations with also an influence on the membership of TDWG or associations TDWG could be a member of.

We will identify funding bodies and opportunities and perform some lobbying and negotiations to attract sponsoring, grants or to be part of funded projects. I will bring in more specifically my long term experience on EU funding opportunities and funding opportunities with African granting bodies such as JRS Biodiversity or the cooperation and development funds of the countries and the EU. We will work in close collaboration with the regional representative and members from the other continents as well to identify funding opportunities worldwide.

### Outreach and Communications, Chair to serve 2025-2026
[Responsibilities](/about/committees/outreach/#responsibilities)

#### Nicky Nicolson
_Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, Richmond, UK_

**Background**
: I worked for about fifteen years in a variety of software development roles at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew [1] helping researchers and curators manage and mobilise scientific information. Effectively this was a research software engineer role [2], it just predated the term. Ten years ago I switched from the technical track into research, where I completed a doctorate in machine learning, applying density based clustering to our digitised specimen data to identify collectors, expeditions and related specimens gathered from a shared collecting event [3]. I took software development practices with me - things like revision control, dependency management, build automation and continuous integration - to help manage the research process. My work was applied in the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data portal where it helps users navigate between related records [4]. Now I'm senior research leader in digital collections at Kew. We are nearing the end of our specimen digitisation project [5], and I'm interested in how we can use our digitised specimen data to build the "digital extended specimen", and how we do this in an open and inclusive way. I am developing a toolkit called "echinopscis: an extensible notebook for open science on specimens" [6], which was partly supported by Open Seeds [7], an open science mentoring and skills development programme.
: I've been involved in TDWG throughout my career, and none of my work would have been possible without the data standards and the community of practice that TDWG has fostered.

**Vision**
: In the past couple of years I have started to work much more closely with the open science community. One crucial distinction that they emphasise is between initiatives which are "open by default" vs those which are "open by design" [8]. As the latter is more intentional, it ensures that participation information is made explicit via resources like roadmaps, contribution guidelines and codes of conduct, all of which help new people to become involved. I see these practices as small steps which we can encourage in TDWG affiliated projects to help grow the community and make it more inclusive.

: I would like to help us build better links between our community and those who are working on software sustainability. In the UK, the software sustainability institute [9] was instrumental in getting the research software engineer job title recognised by funders; today there are RSE networks worldwide [10]. Many in the TDWG community perform RSE-like roles and integrating with these networks can help raise visibility for these roles with our funders. A similar effort is underway to ensure that roles which are focussed on data curation are recognised [11]. Building these links will help develop skills, build new collaborations and grow the community.

: Communication: Keeping in touch with TDWG members and reaching out to new ones is important, and social media has been a key communication tool. This is an evolving landscape, particularly as many step back from Twitter. I would like us to first refresh our LinkedIn profile [12], as many more people are using this platform, and then review potential use of other microblogging platforms like mastodon, bluesky and threads. We should use these channels to share details of relevant events and outputs throughout the year, as well as to promote our annual meeting. I would also encourage TDWG members to complete github profile pages [13] so that the full extent of our community is visible. As more of us are starting to work with artificial intelligence and machine learning, I'd also like to build a TDWG profile on HuggingFace [14], the community hub for sharing models, datasets and application prototypes.

### Time and Place, Chair (serving: 2026-2027)
[Responsibilities](/about/committees/tardis/#responsibilities)

**Kristen "Kit" Lewers** - _Information Science and BioFrontiers Institute, University of Colorado Boulder, and iDigBio, University of Florida, USA_

<a href="https://orcid.org/0000-0003-0526-4075"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 5px 0px 0px;" alt="ORCID logo" src="https://info.orcid.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/orcid_16x16.png" width="16" height="16" /> 0000-0003-0526-4075</a>

**Background**

TLDR: Kit likes aviation, software engineering, biodiversity, data, and remote sensing.

My background in biodiversity began during undergrad, when I spent a transformative summer in Yellowstone National Park researching the social and environmental impacts of trophic cascade disruption, with a focus on the re-introduction of gray wolves (_Canis lupus_). That summer turned into three years of living in one of the most intact—and intriguingly imbalanced—ecosystems in the United States, inspiring me to further my education and career in biodiversity informatics.

I am pursuing my PhD at the University of Colorado Boulder in Information Science and Interdisciplinary Quantitative Biology. I am currently funded by NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center to work on GLiHT (Goddard LiDAR, Hyperspectral, and Thermal) multisensor platform and build the technical infrastructure needed to support their use, in preparation for the Biodiversity Center initiatives as well as the SBG (Surface Biology and Geology) satellite mission. This mission focuses on integrating biodiversity data with full spectrum hyperspectral imagery, marking a significant step forward in remote sensing applications for biodiversity. I previously worked on the NASA BioSCape (Biodiversity Survey of the Cape) to create software packages and processing pipelines for AVIRIS-NG hyperspectral data and LVIS LiDAR data.

At my core, I am an information scientist, my focus includes sociotechnical scholarship that blends software engineering, human-computer interaction, and technical infrastructure applications to social systems of collaboration—primarily through the lens of microservice architecture. To support my efforts at NASA, my dissertation research investigates how information overload impacts institutions grounded in big data, especially regarding the interoperability of biodiversity data and remotely sensed data. This allows me to bridge the gap between technology and the collaborative networks that drive scientific innovation.

Additionally, I work with NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) AOP (Airborne Observation Platform) as an ambassador under the Director of Flight Operations and channel my passion for aviation as the drone program manager for the United States Air Force Auxiliary Boulder Composite Squadron. 

Past projects include developing analysis software to detect structural variants in the human genome from high-throughput sequencing data, harmonizing GBIF and iDigBio records for drone-based remote sensing, creating “Computational Genomics for Everyone” coursework with the BioFrontiers Institute, implementing AI-mediated interventions to prevent information overload, and modeling complex systems with Colorado Firefly Monitoring.

**Vision**

My passion lies in fostering interdisciplinary collaboration and building robust networks within the biodiversity informatics community. As the Time and Place Committee Chair for TDWG, I am dedicated to embedding our vibrant culture into other research communities and making data-driven decisions about conference locations to enhance accessibility, visibility, and involvement. I love to chat about all things biodiversity and technology, so feel free to reach out!

### Regional Representatives

[Responsibilities](/about/executive/responsibilities/#regional-representatives)

{:id="rep-africa"}
### Regional Representative for Africa (serving 2026-2027): 

#### Brice Djiofack

_Background and Vision pending_

<!-- 
### Representiative for Europe

#### Wouter Addink <!-- wouter.addink@naturalis.nl
_Naturalis, Leiden_

**Background**
: I am passionate about open data and increasing collaboration and community building to enable better data mobilisation from natural history collections. I have been working on community projects in Europe for over ten years, including two iterations of the EC-funded SYNTHESYS projects, ICEDIG, DiSSCo Prepare and Mobilise projects. Recently, this has included the proposal writing and leading the collaborative development of [Specimen Data Refinery platform](https://github.com/DiSSCo/SDR) in SYNTHESYS+ and the managing the creation of Digitisation Guides for [DiSSCo Prepare](https://dissco.github.io/).
: I am an active participant in SPNHC and CETAF (especially the Digitisation Working Group), and intend to remain active during my potential tenure. I have extensive experience of collaboration outside of Europe, including delivering e-taxonomy training in four continents, delivering a GBIF BID workshop in Jamaica, and digitisation of Malaysian collections as part of national digitisation initiative. I attended my first TDWG conference in 2014 ([slides](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1219251.v1)), and have attended all in-person European conferences since ([2019](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.10024715.v1) and [2022](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.21312345.v1)). Both myself and my digitisation team use TDWG standards on a day-to-day basis in our projects and are keen to give more user feedback on implementation and use.
: I am an experienced editor of formal publications (Zootaxa, [ZooKeys](https://zookeys.pensoft.net/browse_journal_groups.php?journal_id=2&role_id=3&user_letter=L), [BDJ](https://bdj.pensoft.net/board/)) and for [special collections](https://riojournal.com/topical_collection/84). For examples of community presentations and outreach see my [Figshare profile](https://figshare.com/authors/Laurence_Livermore/100501).

**Vision**
: There are multiple exciting initiatives across Europe which will benefit from global connectivity, including the continued development of DiSSCo and the establishment of national DiSSCo nodes.
: As Regional Representative for Europe, I would maintain and strengthen connections between the other Regional Representatives and promote TDWG's role in developing and promoting the use of biodiversity data standards. DiSSCo, and related initiatives around the world (e.g., GBIFs regional programmes, iDigBio, and ALA), are more effective and efficient when they collaborate and share approaches. Our community still has more to gain from establishing more shared practices, protocols, and training programmes. I would like to promote the co-development of more regional initiatives, or at least help connect people and initiatives that have the potential to benefit by working together.
: I am keen to promote wider participation in SPNHC and will ensure TDWG's work is brought to CETAF's Digitisation Working Group and Information Science and Technology Committee. Over the next two years I will be working to develop the DiSSCo-UK node and want to ensure that our work benefits the wider community, that we implement TDWG standards, and encourage wider participation in TDWG activities.
