- [Steve Baskauf](mailto:steve.baskauf@vanderbilt.edu) - Vanderbilt University Heard Libraries, Nashville, TN, USA

## Core members

- [Neil S. Cobb](mailto:neil.cobb@nau.edu) - Merriam-Powell Center for Environmental Research, Northern Arizona University, AZ, USA
- [Jennifer C. Girón Duque](mailto:jennifer.giron@ttu.edu) - Natural Science Research Laboratory, Museum of Texas Tech University, TX, USA

## Motivation

**NOTE: this Task Group has completed its work and is no longer active.**

The combination of the [Audubon Core](https://www.tdwg.org/standards/ac/) terms [ac:subjectOrientation](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/termlist/#ac_subjectOrientation) and [ac:subjectPart](https://tdwg.github.io/ac/termlist/#ac_subjectPart) are known colloquially as the "view" of the subject. The view is an important characteristic for searching by humans or machines for multimedia resources appropriate for a particular task.

The notes associated with `ac:subjectOrientation` and `ac:subjectPart` currently state that "No formal encoding scheme as yet exists." The purpose of this task group is to develop the missing encoding schemes for these terms by creating two controlled vocabularies to be used as values for these two terms.

## Goals, outputs and outcomes

- Create controlled vocabulary terms for `ac:subjectOrientation`.
- Create controlled vocabulary terms for `ac:subjectPart`.

## Strategy

- Any individuals with an interest in producing or consuming media with described views are welcome to participate in the task group.
- Potential participants can contact the convener for more information about the group. To join, "watch" the [Audubon Core repository on GitHub](https://github.com/tdwg/ac).
- Since the controlled vocabularies constitute coordinated additions to Audubon Core, the Task Group will produce a Feature Report as required in Section 4.2.1 of the TDWG [Vocabulary Maintenance Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/vms/maintenance-specification.md) (VMS) prior to the development of the controlled vocabularies _Target date for completion: December 2019._
- Based on the community needs described in the Feature Report, the Task Group will develop the controlled vocabularies using the guidance given in Section 4.5.4 of the TDWG [Standards Documentation Specification](https://github.com/tdwg/vocab/blob/master/sds/documentation-specification.md), which describes how controlled vocabulary terms will be described using SKOS vocabulary terms. The task group will follow these directions to create SKOS concept schemes to serve as the controlled vocabularies. _Target date for completion: June 2020._
- Following development of the vocabularies, the task group will collect implementation experience data from members of the community who have tried using the draft vocabularies with their data sets. These data will be included in an Implementation Experience Report (Section 4.2.2 of the VMS) that will be completed before submission of the vocabularies for adoption. _Target date for submission for adoption: December 2020._

## History and context

The definition of `ac:subjectOrientation` is: "Specific orientation (= direction, view angle) of the subject represented in the media resource with respect to the acquisition device." The notes include: "Examples: 'dorsal', 'ventral', 'frontal', etc. No formal encoding scheme as yet exists."

The definition of `ac:subjectPart` is: "The portion or product of organism morphology, behaviour, environment, etc. that is either predominantly shown or particularly well exemplified by the media resource." The notes include: "No formal encoding scheme as yet exists. Examples are 'whole body', 'head', 'flower', "leaf", 'canopy' (of a rain forest stand). Several anatomical ontologies are emerging in <http://www.obofoundry.org/>"

## Summary

**NOTE: this Task Group has completed its work and is no longer active.**

The Views Controlled Vocabularies Task Group is developing controlled vocabularies for the Audubon Core terms `ac:subjectOrientation` and `ac:subjectPart`. Anyone can participate in the group by "watching" the Audubon Core GitHib repository (<https://github.com/tdwg/ac>).
