## **Core members**
-   Walter Berendsohn (Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin)

## **Motivation**

The purpose of the ABCD Maintenance Group is to maintain the ABCD
(Access to Biological Collection Data) standard and its associated
vocabularies and to adjust them to new requirements from the community
through the addition and revision of terms.

## **Becoming involved**

The work done by this group is open for participation from all
interested community members. Upcoming meetings are communicated through
the groups communication channels, which are outlined on the community
GitHub page
[https://github.com/tdwg/abcd/tree/master/community](https://github.com/tdwg/abcd/tree/master/community)
.

To suggest changes or additions to ABCD as well as raising general
questions, please create a ticket for it in the GitHub issue tracker:
[https://github.com/tdwg/abcd/issues](https://github.com/tdwg/abcd/issues)
.

Alternatively you can also email the conveners for your input or to be
notified about upcoming meetings.

## **History and context**

Development on ABCD started in 2001 as an XML Schema. Version 2 became a
ratified TDWG standard in 2005 and has since achieved widespread
adoption.

This group will maintain the standard under the current standards
framework outlined by the TDWG bylaws.

## **Summary**

The purpose of the ABCD Maintenance Group is to foster accessibility of
existing and emerging biological collection data banks at the
international level by developing and maintaining a comprehensive and
commented standard for biological collection records. In the process, it
promotes standardization of the terminology used to model biological
collection information and provides a general format for data exchange
and retrieval for biological collections.
