Abstract
: XDF (the Exchange Data Format) is a database file exchange medium to handle diverse classes of biological data required for file transfers between different database projects. Data sets prepared in XDF consists of text files that are effectively independent of any particular project. XDF is a high-level language for describing biological data, with its own syntax and command vocabulary, analogous to the high-level programming languages used to describe software algorithms.

Abstract
: XDF (the Exchange Data Format) is a medium for the exchange of diverse classes of biological data between different database projects and application programs. This document provides a detailed definition of the syntax and conventions followed in the XDF language and of the principal XDF directives. The manual is intended for biologists using XDF either to take advantage of predefined, standard transfer formats or to define their own transfer format.
