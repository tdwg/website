## Where is the Brummitt & Powell "Authors of Plant Names" database?

Since 1998 the database of author names and their standard forms (which formed the basis of the Brummitt & Powell's (1992) Authors of Plant Names) has been maintained and updated on line as part of the Plant Names Project. This database represents a significant improvement to the static one which was hitherto available on our website since it is continuously updated with new entries and additions/corrections to existing entries. Names are still standardized according to the Brummitt & Powell rules; and you can now find authors in the [International Plant Names Index (IPNI) database](https://www.ipni.org/).

## Authors of Plant Names and TDWG

The Taxonomic Databases Working Group (TDWG) adopted the original printed version of Brummitt & Powell (1992) as their data standard for Authors of Plant Names. The adoption of the current live database is still currently under discussion. This would represent a new precedent for TDWG in that all standards adopted to date have been static and in hard copy.

## Parts of the standard

This standard is comprised of one document.
