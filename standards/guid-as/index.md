title: GUID and Life Sciences Identifiers Applicability Statements
description: >
  The Global Unique Identifiers (GUID) applicability statements consist of an applicability statement on the use of GUIDs for the biodiversity information community in general (Richards 2010) and the use of Life Science Identifiers (LSID) in specific (Pereira et al. 2009).

Title
: GUID and Life Sciences Identifiers Applicability Statements

Permanent IRI (for citations and links)
: <http://www.tdwg.org/standards/150>

Publisher
: Biodiversity Information Standards (TDWG)

Ratified

Status
: [Current standard](/standards/status-and-categories/#status)

Category
: [Applicability statement](/standards/status-and-categories/#category)

Abstract
: The TDWG GUID Applicability Statement 1) provides guidance on how to use GUIDs (Globally Unique Identifiers) to meet specific requirements of the biodiversity information community; 2) applies to GUIDs in general; there is, or will be, a separate document for the applicability of each specific GUID technology. The LSID (Life Sciences Applicability Statement) describes how to use that technology.

Abstract
: This document provides guidance on how to use LSID to meet specific requirements of the biodiversity information community; and defines how to identify shared data objects in biodiversity information applications using Life Sciences Identifiers (LSID). It should be read in conjunction with the GUID Applicability Statement
